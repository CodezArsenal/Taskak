# Taskak

https://codezarsenal.github.io/Taskak/

Taskak is a really simple to-do list application intended to have a minimalist user-friendly interface. It's developed using simple html, css, javascript code.

The name (Taskak) consists of two parts, 'Task' and the appended 'ak', which comes in Arabic as a pronoun that gives the meaning of 'yours'. In short, 'Taskak' = 'Your Task' :p

\* This is one of the projects I've developed as a practice in my early days in JS.
